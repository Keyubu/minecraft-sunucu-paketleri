# The locale is set in BCP 47 language tag.
# See this website for some example BCP 74 language tag you can use: https://appmakers.dev/bcp-47-language-codes-list/

# Set this value to false to disable debug mode and do not send debug messages to the console.

# The setting below enables or disables the disabled commands inside certain worlds feature
# When this option is true, the commands that are added to the world inside the list below will be disabled
enable-disabled-worlds: false

# Each command has its own list of worlds that will be disabled.
# If a command is not added or the list with worlds for the specified command is empty,
# the command will work in every world.

    - 'testbuilding'
    sellall:
    - 'randompvp'
    editshop:
    - 'boss-fights'
    - 'Survival-Spawn'

# NOTE: Commands disabled inside worlds with the feature above will still be registered inside the server,
# meaning that a command still can conflict with the same command from another plugin.


#--------------------------------------------SpawnerProvider--------------------------------------------

# This option can be used to set an external spawner provider to use for the spawners inside the shop
# Available values:
# DEFAULT = The default spawner provider inside ESGUI

# NOTE: When there is no spawner provider set, the default will be used


#------------------------------------------PlayerTransactions-------------------------------------------

# When this option is set to true, every time a player sells/buys something from the server, it will output it in the console.
# This way the server owner or staff can see when a item is bought/sold many times or control/correct prices and exploits in the shop.
log-player-transactions: true
# Set to false to disable this.

# Should we drop the remaining items on the ground when the players inventory is full?
drop-remaining-items-on-ground: false
# When this option is false, the plugin will only give the items that fit inside the inventory and the remaining items will be cancelled. The player will only pay for the amount of items that fit inside the inventory.
# Warning: When this option is true, players could lag out your server by buying an insane amount of items that fall on the ground!

# When purchasing a item from shop, should the transaction message say which material was sold/bought from shop or should it be the item name?
use-item-name: true
# When this is false, purchasing/selling a item to shop will cause the message in chat use the material name of the item instead of the item name to let the player know what has been sold/bought

sold-items-ignored-NBTtags:
